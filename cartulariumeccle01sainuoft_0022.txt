guished artists, Mr. Georgc Reid, R.S.A. The first represents
the interior of the crossing and the North Transept (“Coli-
son's Aisle ¹⁹) of the Church of Saint Nicholas, the most ancient
part of the existing fabriC; while the other gives the simple
offigy of Provost Robert Davidson, who fell in 141 1,

“On the field of the red Harlaw''.

There are no illuminations in the manuscript, and but a few
of the initial letters have any ornamentation. None are worth
reproduction. The page which has been reproduced in facsimile
is not only a good specimen of the whole, but is perhaps the
most important document concerning the church in the collection,
and is further interesting as exhibiting the autograph signatures
of no fewer than five successive bishops of Aberdeen—William
Elphinstone‚ the founder of King‘s College (1484-1514)‚
Alexander Gordon (ob. 1518) Gavin Dunbar (ob. 1532), William
Stewart (ob. 1545), and William Gordon (ob. 1577).

The second volume will contain an abridged translation of
the text, with notes and full indices. It will also contain in full
the “ Notes on the Church of Saint Nicholas‚” written in 1818
by the late Mr. James Logan, now in the possession of the
Society of Advocates of Aberdeen. A number of that author's
very beautiful sketches of the old wood-work, many of them
coloured, will be reproduced, together with other illustrations of
such objects of interest belonging to the ancient edifice as have
come down to us The whole will be introduced by a Preface,

giving an architectural and historical account of the church and
some notice of its ministerS.
